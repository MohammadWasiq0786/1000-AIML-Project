"""
Project 877: Education Resource Allocation
Description
Education resource allocation helps ensure that regions with the highest need receive adequate funding, teachers, and infrastructure. In this project, we simulate demographic, infrastructure, and performance data and build a regression model to predict the optimal resource allocation for schools (e.g., teacher-student ratio, funding, infrastructure improvements).

‚úÖ This model can be used for:

Education funding optimization

School improvement planning

Government education policies
