"""
Project 879: Personalized Learning System
Description
A personalized learning system adapts to each student‚Äôs learning pace, strengths, and weaknesses. In this project, we simulate student interaction data and build a recommendation model to suggest learning resources (e.g., videos, quizzes, articles) based on individual student performance and preferences.

‚úÖ This system supports:

Adaptive learning platforms

Automated curriculum planning

Real-time student engagement tracking
