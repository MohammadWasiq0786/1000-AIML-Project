Project 14. Feature selection techniques
Description:
Feature selection helps identify the most relevant features for a model by eliminating irrelevant, redundant, or noisy data. This improves model performance, interpretability, and reduces overfitting. In this project, we demonstrate multiple common feature selection techniques on the Iris dataset.

About:
🔍 Techniques Demonstrated:
Univariate Selection (ANOVA F-test) – Select features individually based on statistical tests.

Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) – Recursively removes less important features.

Tree-Based Feature Importance – Uses models like Random Forest to rank features.

These techniques can be combined with cross-validation, or used with other datasets like customer churn or credit scoring.
