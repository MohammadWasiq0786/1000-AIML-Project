Project 706: Audio-Visual Synchronization
Description:
Audio-Visual Synchronization involves aligning audio and video streams to ensure that they are in sync, especially in applications such as lip-syncing, video dubbing, and multimedia editing. In this project, we will implement a system that synchronizes audio and visual streams using cross-correlation techniques and neural networks. The goal is to align the audio features with the corresponding visual features, ensuring accurate synchronization between the two.

In this implementation, we'll align the audio signal with its corresponding video by extracting audio features (MFCC) and visual features (mouth region images), and using cross-correlation to find the time shift that best aligns the two streams.

Explanation:
In this Audio-Visual Synchronization system:

Audio Features: We extract MFCC features from the audio signal using Librosa.

Visual Features: We extract the mouth region from the video frames using OpenCV.

Cross-Correlation: We use cross-correlation to find the optimal time shift (lag) that aligns the audio features with the visual features. The lag represents the time shift needed to synchronize the two streams.

This approach is based on feature alignment, where we compute the degree of similarity between the audio and visual features over different time shifts and identify the best alignment.
