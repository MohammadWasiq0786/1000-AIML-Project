Project 700: Audio Super-Resolution
Description:
Audio super-resolution is the process of improving the quality of low-resolution audio signals, particularly to enhance fine details like high frequencies or subtle sounds. This can be useful for applications in music restoration, speech enhancement, and audio forensics. In this project, we will implement an audio super-resolution system using a deep learning model to upscale low-resolution audio (e.g., low sample rate) to a higher quality (higher sample rate) and recover lost details.

We can use WaveNet or a deep learning model trained for audio super-resolution. Here's a simple implementation of upsampling audio using neural networks for audio restoration. For this example, we'll focus on a simple interpolation method (i.e., increasing the sample rate) combined with wavelet transforms for better results. A more advanced system would involve WaveNet or SRCNN.

In this Audio Super-Resolution project, we upsample low-resolution audio by increasing the sample rate, using a simple interpolation method (resample). This helps to recover high-frequency details that are lost when the audio is downsampled.

To improve quality, neural network-based models like WaveNet or SRCNN can be used for more sophisticated super-resolution, which learns to enhance the audio details from data.
