Project 717: Child Speech Recognition
Description:
Child speech recognition focuses on improving the accuracy of speech recognition systems when dealing with speech from children. Children’s speech can differ significantly from adult speech in terms of pronunciation, pitch, and speech patterns. In this project, we will implement a speech recognition system specifically designed for children’s voices by using transfer learning, fine-tuning, or data augmentation techniques.

In this project, we'll use a pre-trained model like Wav2Vec 2.0 and fine-tune it with a child speech dataset (e.g., Child Speech Corpus or any available dataset with children’s speech). The model will be trained to handle the characteristics of child speech, such as higher pitch and faster or slower speech rate.

Required Libraries:
pip install transformers datasets torchaudio librosa

Explanation:
Pre-trained Wav2Vec 2.0 Model: We load a pre-trained Wav2Vec 2.0 model from Hugging Face, which has been trained on large amounts of general speech data.

Child Speech Dataset: We use a child speech dataset (such as CommonVoice for English or a specialized child speech corpus) to fine-tune the model. You can replace CommonVoice with a dataset specifically containing children's voices.

Fine-Tuning: The pre-trained model is fine-tuned on the child speech data to adapt it to the specific characteristics of children’s speech. This allows the model to perform better when transcribing speech from children.

Speech Recognition: After fine-tuning, we use the model to transcribe speech from a new child audio file.

For a real-world system, it's important to have a large labeled dataset of children's speech for fine-tuning and to consider data augmentation techniques to further improve performance on low-resource datasets.
