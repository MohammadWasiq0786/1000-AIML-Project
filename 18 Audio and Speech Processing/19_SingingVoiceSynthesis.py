Project 698: Singing Voice Synthesis
Description:
Singing voice synthesis refers to generating realistic singing voices from text or melodies. This is particularly useful in applications such as virtual singers, music production, and automated song creation. In this project, we will implement a singing voice synthesis system using a pre-trained model like DeepSinger or a text-to-speech model trained on singing data. The system will generate a singing voice from a given melody and lyrics.

For singing voice synthesis, advanced models like DeepSinger are typically used. These models are trained on large datasets of singing voices and convert MIDI sequences or text input into singing voice output.

Since the actual implementation involves complex models that require large datasets and fine-tuning, I'll provide a simplified example using a pre-trained TTS (text-to-speech) model and a basic melody generation system. However, for more advanced real-world applications, you would likely need to explore WaveNet, Tacotron, or DeepSinger for high-quality results.

For the simplified version, we can use Google's Text-to-Speech (gTTS) to synthesize speech based on input lyrics, and combine that with a simple melody generation system. This won't produce true "singing" but can be a basic starting point.

This basic singing voice synthesis project uses a sine wave melody for simplicity and the gTTS library for synthesizing speech from lyrics. The resulting audio combines the generated speech with a melody, but for real singing synthesis, deep learning models like WaveNet, Tacotron, or DeepSinger are typically employed.
