Project 716: Accented Speech Recognition
Description:
Accented speech recognition involves improving the accuracy of speech recognition systems for speakers with different accents. Accents can significantly impact the performance of speech recognition models, especially when they are not trained on diverse speech data. In this project, we will focus on building a speech recognition system that works well with a variety of accents by either fine-tuning pre-trained models or using accent-specific datasets to increase the model's robustness to different accents.

To handle accented speech, we will use a pre-trained speech recognition model (e.g., Wav2Vec 2.0) and fine-tune it on an accented dataset to improve its ability to recognize speech from diverse accents.

Required Libraries:
pip install transformers datasets torchaudio librosa

Explanation:
Wav2Vec 2.0 Pre-trained Model: We use the Wav2Vec 2.0 model from Hugging Face for speech recognition. Wav2Vec 2.0 is pre-trained on a large corpus of speech data and can be fine-tuned for specific tasks, including accented speech recognition.

Dataset: We use an accented speech dataset like CommonVoice. You can use datasets with diverse accents or fine-tune the model on specific accent data (e.g., British English, African American Vernacular English, etc.).

Fine-Tuning: The model is fine-tuned on the accented dataset using a simple training loop with AdamW optimization.

Speech Recognition: After fine-tuning, we use the model to transcribe speech from new audio files containing accented speech.

By fine-tuning a pre-trained model like Wav2Vec 2.0 on an accented speech dataset, we can improve its performance for different accents, even when the data is limited. For better results, consider using more diverse and large datasets or applying data augmentation techniques.
