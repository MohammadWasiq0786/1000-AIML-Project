Project 715: Low-Resource Speech Recognition
Description:
Low-resource speech recognition refers to building speech recognition systems for languages or dialects that lack large annotated datasets or resources (e.g., audio corpora, linguistic models). This is a challenging task, as most modern speech recognition systems rely on large amounts of labeled data to train accurate models. In this project, we will explore methods to build speech recognition systems for low-resource languages using transfer learning, data augmentation, and unsupervised learning techniques.

For this project, we'll use pre-trained models (such as DeepSpeech or Wav2Vec 2.0) and fine-tune them for a low-resource language using smaller datasets. The Hugging Face Transformers library provides models like Wav2Vec 2.0 that can be fine-tuned on smaller datasets for low-resource languages.

Steps:
Install the required libraries:

pip install transformers datasets torchaudio
Use a pre-trained Wav2Vec 2.0 model for transfer learning.

Explanation:
Pre-trained Wav2Vec 2.0 Model: We use Wav2Vec 2.0, a pre-trained model for speech recognition. This model is trained on a large corpus of speech and can be fine-tuned for low-resource languages with smaller datasets.

Fine-tuning: We demonstrate how to fine-tune a pre-trained Wav2Vec 2.0 model on a low-resource language dataset. You can substitute this with any smaller speech dataset from a low-resource language.

Speech Recognition: We use the fine-tuned model to perform speech-to-text conversion on a new audio file.

For real-world low-resource language recognition, it's important to gather as much data as possible for fine-tuning and explore techniques like data augmentation (e.g., pitch shifting, time-stretching) to enhance the training process.
