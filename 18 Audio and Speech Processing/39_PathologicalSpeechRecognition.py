Project 718: Pathological Speech Recognition
Description:
Pathological speech recognition refers to the task of recognizing speech that is affected by various disorders or conditions such as Parkinson's disease, stroke, or ALS (Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis). These conditions often result in speech impairments like slurred speech, tremors, or reduced volume. In this project, we will focus on building a speech recognition system that can handle pathological speech, enabling accurate transcription for people with speech impairments. We will fine-tune a pre-trained model using a dataset containing pathological speech and apply speech enhancement and noise reduction techniques.

For this project, we will use a pre-trained speech recognition model like Wav2Vec 2.0 and fine-tune it using a pathological speech dataset. If a suitable dataset is unavailable, you can apply data augmentation techniques (such as speed variation, pitch shifting, and background noise) to simulate pathological speech variations.

Required Libraries:
pip install transformers datasets torchaudio librosa

Explanation:
Pre-trained Wav2Vec 2.0 Model: We load a pre-trained Wav2Vec 2.0 model, which has been trained on large amounts of general speech data. This model is fine-tuned on a pathological speech dataset to improve its performance with speech impairments.

Dataset: In this example, we use the CommonVoice dataset, but you can replace it with a pathological speech dataset (e.g., speech from individuals with Parkinson's disease, ALS, or stroke).

Fine-Tuning: We fine-tune the model on the pathological speech dataset using a simple training loop. The model adapts to the specific characteristics of pathological speech (e.g., tremors, slurred speech).

Speech Recognition: After fine-tuning, the model is used to transcribe new pathological speech audio files.

For better results, you would need a larger and more diverse pathological speech dataset. Techniques like data augmentation, feature enhancement, or noise reduction can also be used to improve the modelâ€™s robustness to pathological speech variations.
