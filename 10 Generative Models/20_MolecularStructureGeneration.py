Project 380. Molecular structure generation
Description:
Molecular structure generation uses generative models to create molecular structures, which can be used for drug discovery, material science, and chemistry. These models are typically trained on large datasets of molecular structures and generate new molecules by learning the underlying rules and relationships between atoms and bonds.

In this project, we will implement a simple generative model for molecular structure generation, using a graph-based approach to represent molecules as graphs where atoms are nodes and bonds are edges.

About:
âœ… What It Does:
Defines a simple neural network model for generating molecular structures, with latent vectors (z) mapping to atom types and bond types.

The Molecular Generator uses fully connected layers to generate a simple molecular structure.

Graph-based approach is used to model molecules, where atoms are nodes and bonds are edges in a graph.

Generates and visualizes molecular structures using the RDKit library (using SMILES format for simplicity).
