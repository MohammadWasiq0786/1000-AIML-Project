Project 398. Deepfake detection system
Description:
Deepfakes are hyper-realistic but manipulated videos or images created using generative models like GANs. They can be used for various purposes, including entertainment, but also for misinformation. A deepfake detection system aims to identify these manipulated media by examining the inconsistencies in the video or image, such as unusual facial expressions, unnatural lighting, or inconsistencies in the background.

In this project, we will implement a deepfake detection system using a pre-trained deep learning model to classify whether a video or image is a deepfake or real.

About:
âœ… What It Does:
Deepfake Detection uses a pre-trained Xception model to classify images (or frames from a video) as real or fake.

The model processes the input image, and the CNN-based architecture is used to detect discrepancies typical of deepfakes.

Visualizes the input image and provides a prediction based on the model.

Key features:
Xception model is used here for image classification, but other models like EfficientNet or ResNet can also be used for deepfake detection.

This model can be fine-tuned with a deepfake dataset like FaceForensics++ for better results.

The real/fake prediction can be used for video deepfake detection by processing frames individually.
