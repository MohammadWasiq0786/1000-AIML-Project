"""
Project 909. Cyberbullying Detection

Cyberbullying detection identifies harmful, harassing, or abusive messages directed at individuals‚Äîoften on social media or messaging platforms. In this project, we simulate chat data and use a text classification model to detect cyberbullying using supervised learning.

What It Does:
Flags harmful messages using keyword patterns

Uses TF-IDF + Logistic Regression for fast and interpretable results

üí° To make it production-grade:

Add contextual features (replies, targets)

Use deep learning (LSTM, BERT) for nuanced language

Include real-time filters in chat systems or comment sections
