"""
Project 905. Fake Account Detection

Fake account detection helps platforms identify accounts created for spam, fraud, or manipulation. In this project, we simulate user profile data and use a classification model to flag accounts as fake or genuine based on features like profile completeness, activity level, and creation timing.

Key Features:
Profile completeness (picture, bio)

Account age

Activity level

ðŸ§  In real systems:

Use IP/email/device fingerprints

Combine behavioral features (e.g., burst posting, friend patterns)

Leverage graph analysis for coordinated networks
