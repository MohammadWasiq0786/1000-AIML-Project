"""
Project 896. Password Strength Evaluation

A password strength evaluation system assesses how secure a password is based on its length, complexity, and entropy. In this project, we simulate a basic password strength meter that classifies passwords as Weak, Moderate, or Strong.

What It Checks:
Length: Longer passwords are harder to brute-force.

Character diversity: Encourages use of uppercase, lowercase, digits, symbols.

Score-based logic: Adjustable thresholds for real-world applications.

üîê Advanced versions may include:

Entropy calculation

Blacklist check (common passwords)

Zxcvbn scoring (as used by Dropbox)

    score = sum([has_upper, has_lower, has_digit, has_symbol])
