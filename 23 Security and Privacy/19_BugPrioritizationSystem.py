"""
Project 899. Bug Prioritization System

A bug prioritization system classifies reported bugs by their urgency or importance so that development teams can resolve the most critical issues first. In this project, we simulate a dataset of bug reports and use a text classification model to predict priority levels (e.g., Low, Medium, High).

Why Itâ€™s Useful:
Prioritizes bugs automatically based on semantic analysis of their descriptions.

Can be integrated with bug tracking systems (e.g., Jira, GitHub Issues).

ðŸ“ˆ Advanced ideas:

Include features like frequency of reports, affected users, or crash logs.

Use BERT or other transformers for more context-aware classification.
