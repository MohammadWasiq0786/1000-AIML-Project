"""
Project 901. Dynamic Code Analysis

Dynamic code analysis monitors a program while it's running to detect issues like memory leaks, unhandled exceptions, or insecure behavior. In this project, we simulate runtime monitoring of Python code by capturing function calls, exceptions, and execution time using decorators.

What This Does:
Tracks execution time of functions

Logs exceptions with tracebacks

Can be extended to monitor memory usage, API calls, or file access

ðŸ§ª Real-world dynamic analysis tools include:

Python tracers (sys.settrace, cProfile, Py-Spy)

Instrumentation frameworks (e.g., Dynatrace, Valgrind, AppDynamics)

Integration with test coverage and fuzzing tools
