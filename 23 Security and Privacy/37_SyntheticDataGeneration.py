"""
Project 917. Synthetic Data Generation

Synthetic data generation creates artificial datasets that resemble real data but do not contain any actual personal recordsâ€”useful for privacy-preserving analysis, ML model training, or testing.

In this project, we generate synthetic tabular data using scikit-learnâ€™s make_classification, which mimics a real-world binary classification dataset.

What It Demonstrates:
Generates structured data that preserves statistical properties of real data.

No original records usedâ€”preserves privacy.

Useful for testing, ML training, and data sharing.

ðŸ§  Advanced Tools:

CTGAN / TVAE via SDV library (https://sdv.dev/)

Gretel.ai, Hazy, or Mostly AI for enterprise-grade synthetic data

Use in healthcare, finance, or regulated industries
