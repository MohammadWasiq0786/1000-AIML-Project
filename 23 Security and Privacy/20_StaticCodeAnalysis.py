"""
Project 900. Static Code Analysis

Static code analysis examines source code without executing it to detect potential bugs, code smells, security vulnerabilities, and style violations. In this project, we simulate a static code analysis tool that scans Python files for risky patterns (like use of eval, hardcoded passwords, or missing exception handling).

What It Detects:
Dangerous use of eval()

Hardcoded credentials

Unsafe operations (like divide by zero)

Lack of exception handling scaffolding (basic)

üõ°Ô∏è In real tools:

Use AST parsers (ast, pylint, bandit, flake8) for structured analysis

Export reports as HTML/JSON for CI pipelines

Extend to language-specific linters and security scanners
