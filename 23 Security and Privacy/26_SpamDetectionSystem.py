"""
Project 906. Spam Detection System

A spam detection system classifies incoming messages (e.g., emails, comments) as spam or ham (not spam). In this project, we simulate message content and train a simple text classification model using TfidfVectorizer + Naive Bayes.

Why This Works:
TF-IDF captures word importance and spam-specific language.

Naive Bayes works well with high-dimensional text features.

üì© In real-world applications:

Use preprocessing (stopwords, lemmatization)

Detect obfuscation (e.g., ‚Äúfr33 m0ney‚Äù)

Upgrade to transformer models for contextual spam detection
