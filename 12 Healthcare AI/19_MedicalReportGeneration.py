"""
Project 459. Medical report generation
Description:
Medical report generation involves automatically creating diagnostic or radiology reports from medical images or clinical notes. In this project, we'll simulate a text generation system that takes in a brief patient case description and generates a summary report using a Transformer-based language model.

About:
âœ… What It Does:
Accepts a patient summary and generates a radiology-style report continuation.

Uses DistilGPT2 here, but can be replaced with domain-specific models like BioGPT, MedPalm, or ClinicalT5.

Can be extended to:

Generate reports directly from image embeddings

Train on real radiology report corpora

Add sectioned outputs (e.g., Impression, Findings)

For real use cases, you can fine-tune models like:

BioGPT, PubMedBERT, or T5 on MIMIC-CXR reports

Use datasets like IU X-ray, MIMIC-CXR, OpenI
