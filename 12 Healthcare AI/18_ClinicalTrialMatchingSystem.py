"""
Project 458. Clinical trial matching system
Description:
A Clinical Trial Matching System automatically matches patients to relevant clinical trials based on diagnosis, genetic markers, location, or demographics. In this project, we simulate a text-based retrieval model using patient profiles and trial eligibility criteria, and compute a similarity score to suggest matching trials.

âœ… What It Does:
Converts free-text patient data and trial eligibility into TF-IDF vectors.

Uses cosine similarity to rank the best clinical trial matches.

Can be extended to:

Use BERT embeddings (e.g., BioBERT, ClinicalBERT) for better semantic matching

Include structured filters (e.g., age, sex, biomarkers)

Create a recommendation dashboard for trial coordinators

You can later use real data from:

ClinicalTrials.gov API

UMLS + EHR structured data
