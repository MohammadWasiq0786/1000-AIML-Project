"""
Project 461. Medical chatbot implementation
Description:
A medical chatbot assists users with health-related queries, symptoms, and advice. It can provide general information, recommend next steps, or route users to professionals. In this project, we'll implement a rule-based + LLM hybrid chatbot that simulates a basic symptom checker with natural responses.

âœ… What It Does:
Uses rule-based logic for known symptoms.

Falls back to GPT-2 for conversational replies.

Can be extended to:

Use BioGPT, MedAlpaca, or ChatGPT API

Integrate with FHIR data, triage tools, or appointment scheduling

Add speech input/output for voice-driven bots

For real-world systems:

Use LangChain, Rasa, or Haystack

Integrate clinical knowledge bases like SNOMED CT, UMLS, or MedlinePlus
