Project 471. Cancer subtype classification
Description:
Cancer subtype classification helps identify specific molecular or histological types of cancer (e.g., HER2+, triple-negative breast cancer, etc.), which informs personalized treatment plans. In this project, we simulate a gene expression dataset and train a classifier to predict cancer subtypes.

About:
âœ… What It Does:
Simulates gene expression data for 3 common breast cancer subtypes.

Uses a Random Forest classifier to predict subtype from expression profiles.

Can be extended to:

Use real omics data (RNA-seq, microarray)

Perform feature selection (e.g., DEGs, top 500 genes)

Visualize results with UMAP, t-SNE, or confusion matrices

In real-world use:

Use datasets like TCGA, METABRIC, or GEO

Apply methods like PCA, log normalization, or feature selection on omics data
