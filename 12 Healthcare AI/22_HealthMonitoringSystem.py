"""
Project 462. Health monitoring system
Description:
A Health Monitoring System continuously tracks user vitals such as heart rate, temperature, SpO2, or steps, and provides alerts when anomalies occur. In this project, we'll simulate real-time data streaming and use basic threshold-based logic to flag abnormal health conditions.

About:
âœ… What It Does:
Simulates live data from health sensors.

Monitors for threshold violations.

Prints real-time alerts for abnormal vitals.

Can be extended to:

Integrate live wearable data via APIs

Send email/SMS notifications

Use machine learning models for personalized baselines and anomaly detection

For real-world systems:

Integrate with wearable APIs (e.g., Fitbit, Apple Health, Garmin)

Use platforms like Edge AI, Raspberry Pi, or IoT sensors
