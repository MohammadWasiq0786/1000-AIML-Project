Project 478. Clinical decision support system
Description:
A Clinical Decision Support System (CDSS) helps healthcare professionals make informed decisions by offering intelligent recommendations based on patient data. These can include diagnostic suggestions, treatment options, or alerts based on guidelines. In this project, we simulate a rule-based CDSS for chronic diseases using structured patient inputs.

About:
âœ… What It Does:
Takes structured patient data as input.

Applies rule-based logic to generate actionable recommendations.

Easily extendable to:

Use AI models trained on patient outcome data

Generate personalized alerts, treatment options, or diagnostic differentials

Integrate with FHIR EHRs or deploy in clinical dashboards

Real-world integration:

Link to EHR systems using FHIR APIs

Use clinical guidelines (e.g., ADA, JNC8) or ML models trained on historical outcomes
