Project 474. Medical knowledge graph
Description:
A Medical Knowledge Graph (KG) organizes relationships among medical entities like diseases, symptoms, drugs, and treatments. It enables reasoning, semantic search, and clinical decision support. In this project, we'll create a simple KG using NetworkX and simulate queries like "Which drugs treat hypertension?"

âœ… What It Does:
Constructs a mini medical knowledge graph.

Supports queries like treatments, side effects, and connections.

Extendable to:

Parse real data from PubMed abstracts or clinical notes

Add reasoning with graph embeddings or LLMs

Deploy in clinical assistants for structured Q&A

Real-world sources:

UMLS, SNOMED CT, DrugBank, MeSH

Tools: Neo4j, RDF/SPARQL, KG-BERT for link prediction
