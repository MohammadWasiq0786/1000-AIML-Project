Project 727: Integrated Gradients Implementation
Description:
Integrated Gradients is a method for explaining the predictions of machine learning models by attributing the prediction to individual features. It works by calculating the integral of the gradients of the model's output with respect to the input features along a straight line from a baseline (e.g., a black image or a zero-input image) to the actual input. The accumulated gradients along this path are used to assign importance to each feature. This method helps in understanding how changes in the input features affect the model's output.

Explanation:
Image Preprocessing: The load_image() function loads and preprocesses an image, resizing it to 224x224 pixels and normalizing it for the ResNet50 model.

Model Loading: We use ResNet50, a pre-trained CNN model, to perform image classification on the input image.

Compute Integrated Gradients: The compute_integrated_gradients() function calculates the integrated gradients by performing linear interpolation between a baseline image (usually a black image or zero input) and the actual image, then calculating gradients at each step and averaging them. This gives us the attribution of features that contributed to the predicted class.

Visualization: The visualize_integrated_gradients() function visualizes the integrated gradients by overlaying them on the original image. The heatmap generated shows which parts of the image contributed most to the prediction.

This approach gives us insight into which features of the image were most important for the modelâ€™s decision, enhancing the explainability of the model.
