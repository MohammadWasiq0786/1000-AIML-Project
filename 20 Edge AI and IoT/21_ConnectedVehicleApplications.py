"""
Project 781: Connected Vehicle Applications
Description
Connected vehicles collect and share data via onboard sensors (GPS, speed, engine metrics) to enhance safety, traffic flow, and predictive maintenance. In this project, we simulate vehicle telemetry and build a model to detect aggressive driving behavior (e.g., sudden acceleration, harsh braking), which is crucial for safety scoring and fleet monitoring.

This is a core piece for driver scoring apps, insurance telematics, or fleet safety dashboards, and can be deployed on in-vehicle edge compute units using low-latency models.
