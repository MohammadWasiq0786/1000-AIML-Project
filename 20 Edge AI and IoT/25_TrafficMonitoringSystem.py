Project 785: Traffic Monitoring System
Description
A traffic monitoring system uses sensors or cameras to track vehicle flow, detect congestion, and optimize signal timing in real-time. In this project, we simulate traffic sensor data (vehicle count, speed, weather, time of day) and use a classifier model to predict traffic congestion status (congested vs. smooth).

This approach can be adapted for live feeds from camera-based CV systems, loop detectors, or GPS-enabled fleet data to inform smart traffic signals, routing apps, or city dashboards.
