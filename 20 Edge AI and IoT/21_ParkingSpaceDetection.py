Project 786: Parking Space Detection
Description
Smart parking systems detect available parking spaces using sensors or camera feeds and guide vehicles accordingly. This project simulates sensor data from parking lots (e.g., ultrasonic or image-based sensors) and uses a binary classification model to predict whether a spot is occupied or vacant.

This can be adapted for real-time deployment on devices like Raspberry Pi + ultrasonic sensor, or integrated into camera-based detection systems using edge vision models.
