Project 794: Smart Surveillance System
Description
A smart surveillance system uses computer vision to detect unusual activity, track people or objects, and issue alerts for security threats. AI enables real-time video stream analysis for applications like intrusion detection, loitering, or object abandonment. In this project, we simulate a basic person detection system using image input and a pre-trained object detection model (MobileNet-SSD).

âœ… What this does:

Detects people in an image using MobileNet-SSD.

Can be extended to video streams using cv2.VideoCapture(0) for live feed.

Basis for further features: intrusion zones, abandoned object alerts, or time-based tracking.

For deployment, it can be installed on NVIDIA Jetson, Raspberry Pi (with Coral TPU), or smart IP cameras.
