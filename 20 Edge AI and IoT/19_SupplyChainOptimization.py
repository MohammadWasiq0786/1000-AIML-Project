Project 779: Supply Chain Optimization
Description
Supply chain optimization involves predicting demand, managing inventory, and scheduling shipments to reduce costs and delays. AI helps by forecasting product demand and optimizing stock levels. In this simulation, we'll use historical order data to predict future demand using a regression model (DNN), which can be used to automate restocking decisions.

This model helps businesses anticipate inventory needs, reduce waste, and automate restocking. It can be deployed on cloud dashboards or edge-based warehouse systems using lightweight AI inference.
