Project 619: Cooperative Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning Using DQN
Description:
Cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (CMARL) focuses on scenarios where multiple agents work together to achieve a common goal. The agents share information and learn from each otherâ€™s experiences to maximize a joint reward function. In this project, we will implement cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning, where agents interact in a shared environment, learning to cooperate for a collective objective.
