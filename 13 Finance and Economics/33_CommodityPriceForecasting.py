Project 513: Commodity Price Forecasting
Description:
Commodity price forecasting involves predicting the future price of commodities like oil, gold, wheat, or natural gas based on historical data, market trends, and economic factors. In this project, we will predict the price of a commodity (e.g., gold) using time series forecasting methods like ARIMA or LSTM for more advanced predictions.

For real-world applications:

Use historical commodity price data from sources like Yahoo Finance, FRED, or Quandl.

Enhance the model with external factors like currency exchange rates, geopolitical events, or interest rates.

About:
âœ… What It Does:
Downloads historical commodity price data (e.g., gold price) from Yahoo Finance.

Splits the data into training and test sets (80% for training, 20% for testing).

Fits an ARIMA model on the training data to model the commodity price time series.

Forecasts future prices on the test set using the trained ARIMA model.

Evaluates the model's accuracy using Mean Absolute Error (MAE).

Visualizes the actual and predicted commodity prices.

Key Extensions and Customizations:
Use multiple commodities: You can extend this project by forecasting prices for multiple commodities (e.g., oil, natural gas, or wheat).

Incorporate external data: Add external factors such as currency exchange rates, inflation rates, or geopolitical events that may impact commodity prices.

Advanced models: Use more advanced models like LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) or Prophet for better forecasting on complex time series data.

Backtesting: Implement backtesting to simulate real trading conditions using historical data.
