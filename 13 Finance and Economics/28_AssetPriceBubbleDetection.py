Project 508: Asset Price Bubble Detection
Description:
Asset price bubbles occur when the price of an asset exceeds its intrinsic value, often driven by speculation, leading to a crash when the bubble bursts. Detecting these bubbles early can help investors avoid significant losses. In this project, we will use a simple model based on price-to-earnings ratios (P/E ratio), historical price trends, and moving averages to detect potential asset bubbles.

For real-world applications:

Use data from real financial markets or specific assets like real estate, stocks, or cryptocurrencies.

Implement more advanced techniques like machine learning or market indicators to improve bubble detection accuracy.

About:
âœ… What It Does:
Downloads stock price data (Apple stock in this case) and calculates 50-day and 200-day moving averages.

Detects potential asset price bubbles based on how much the price deviates from the long-term moving average (using a threshold of 20% above the 200-day moving average).

Visualizes the stock price, moving averages, and bubble detection signals.

Identifies periods where the price exceeds the set threshold (indicating potential bubbles).

Key Extensions and Customizations:
Use real-world data: Apply the bubble detection model to other asset classes like real estate, commodities, or cryptocurrencies.

Advanced methods: Implement more complex models like machine learning or time-series analysis to detect bubbles based on multiple features such as P/E ratio, market sentiment, and economic conditions.

Different bubble indicators: Combine Bollinger Bands, momentum indicators, and economic data to improve bubble detection accuracy.
