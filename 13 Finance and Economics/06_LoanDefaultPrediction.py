Project 486: Loan Default Prediction
Description:
Loan default prediction helps financial institutions determine whether a borrower is likely to default on a loan. The goal is to use various features (e.g., credit score, income, loan amount, and financial behavior) to predict the likelihood of default. In this project, we will use a Random Forest Classifier to predict whether a borrower will default based on their financial information.

For real-world applications:

Use datasets from loan providers, credit bureaus, or banking systems.

âœ… What It Does:
Simulates loan data (credit score, income, loan amount, debt-to-income ratio) and predicts loan default.

Uses Random Forest Classifier to build a model that predicts whether a loan will default.

Evaluates the model using classification metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score.

Scales the features to improve model performance.

Key Extensions and Customizations:
Use real-world loan data to enhance the accuracy and reliability of the model.

Incorporate more features like employment history, financial assets, and loan type.

Model improvement: Experiment with Gradient Boosting models (e.g., XGBoost, LightGBM) for better predictive power.

Add interpretability: Use tools like SHAP or LIME to explain the model's decisions and provide transparency in loan approval processes.
