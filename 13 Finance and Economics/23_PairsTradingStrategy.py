Project 503: Pairs Trading Strategy
Description:
Pairs trading is a market-neutral strategy that involves identifying two stocks that historically move together (i.e., they are cointegrated) and taking advantage of temporary divergences in their prices. The strategy involves going long on one stock and shorting the other when their price ratio deviates from the historical norm. In this project, we will implement a basic pairs trading strategy using cointegration to select pairs of stocks and generate trading signals.

For real-world applications:

Use cointegration tests to identify pairs of stocks with historically strong relationships.

This strategy can be expanded by adding stop-loss, take-profit, or risk management.

âœ… What It Does:
Performs a cointegration test to check if two stocks (Apple and Microsoft) are cointegrated, which means their price relationship is stable over time.

Calculates the spread between the two stocks using linear regression to determine the relationship.

Generates trading signals:

Buy Signal: When the spread is more than one standard deviation below the mean (indicating the spread is too wide).

Sell Signal: When the spread is more than one standard deviation above the mean (indicating the spread is too narrow).

Plots the spread along with the trading signals, showing where the strategy would have generated buy and sell signals.

Key Extensions and Customizations:
Real-time data: Replace historical data with live market data to implement the strategy in real-time using APIs such as Alpaca, Binance, or Yahoo Finance.

Multiple pairs: Extend the strategy to trade multiple pairs of stocks and optimize portfolio allocations.

Risk management: Add stop-loss or take-profit rules to manage risk more effectively.

Backtesting: Implement backtesting to evaluate the performance of the strategy over a historical dataset.
