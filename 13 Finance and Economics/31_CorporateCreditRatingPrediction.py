Project 511: Corporate Credit Rating Prediction
Description:
Corporate credit rating prediction is essential for financial institutions to assess the creditworthiness of companies. Credit ratings indicate the likelihood that a company will default on its debt obligations. In this project, we will use financial features such as debt levels, profitability, and liquidity ratios to predict a company's credit rating (e.g., AAA, AA, A, BBB, etc.) using machine learning models.

ðŸ§ª Python Implementation (Corporate Credit Rating Prediction with Logistic Regression)
For real-world applications:

Use real credit rating datasets (e.g., Moody's or S&P Global data) for training the model.

You can extend the model by integrating macroeconomic factors or market data to improve prediction accuracy.

About:
âœ… What It Does:
Simulates financial data for companies, including features like debt-to-equity, return on assets, current ratio, and interest coverage ratio.

Uses Logistic Regression to classify the company's credit rating into categories such as AAA, AA, A, and BBB.

Evaluates the model using classification metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score.

Visualizes the feature importance (coefficients of the logistic regression) to understand which financial ratios most influence the credit rating prediction.

Key Extensions and Customizations:
Real-world data: Use actual credit rating datasets from Moody's, S&P Global, or other financial institutions.

Advanced models: Use models like Random Forest, XGBoost, or Neural Networks to improve prediction accuracy.

Macroeconomic data: Integrate broader economic indicators like interest rates, GDP growth, or inflation to enhance the model's forecasting capabilities.

Credit risk analysis: Extend this model to assess credit risk by incorporating additional features such as historical defaults or market volatility.
