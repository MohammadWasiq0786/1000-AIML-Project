Project 490: Options Pricing Model
Description:
Options pricing is an essential task in financial markets, where the price of an option (call or put) is determined based on factors such as underlying asset price, strike price, time to expiration, volatility, and interest rate. In this project, we will implement the Black-Scholes model, one of the most commonly used models for pricing European-style options.

In real-world use:

Extend this model to handle more complex options like American-style options or use Monte Carlo simulations for exotic options.

âœ… What It Does:
Black-Scholes Formula is used to calculate the price of a European call option.

It takes in parameters like stock price, strike price, time to expiration, volatility, and interest rate.

Plots the option price against the underlying stock price to visualize the relationship.

Key Extensions and Customizations:
Put options: You can extend the formula for put option pricing using the Black-Scholes model by applying the put-call parity.

Volatility surface: Explore how the option price changes with volatility over time or across different stocks.

Monte Carlo simulations: Implement Monte Carlo methods for pricing exotic options that may not have closed-form solutions.
