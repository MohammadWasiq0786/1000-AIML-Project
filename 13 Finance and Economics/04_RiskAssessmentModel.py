Project 484: Risk Assessment Model
Description:
Risk assessment is crucial in finance for evaluating potential investment risks or the creditworthiness of borrowers. In this project, we simulate a risk scoring system for credit applications, where we use logistic regression to predict the likelihood of a borrower defaulting on a loan based on their financial features.

In a real-world system, you can use:

Credit Bureau data, FICO scores, loan history datasets

âœ… What It Does:
Simulates borrower data including credit score, income, loan amount, debt-to-income ratio, and employment status.

Logistic regression is used to predict whether a borrower will default on a loan.

Evaluates the model's performance using precision, recall, and F1-score metrics.

Scales numerical features and makes predictions for new applicants.

Key Extensions and Customizations:
Use real-world financial data: Integrate datasets like credit history, loan repayment records, or customer data for more accurate predictions.

Advanced modeling: Implement more sophisticated models like random forests, XGBoost, or neural networks for better performance.

Model explainability: Use techniques like SHAP or LIME to explain model predictions to end-users.
