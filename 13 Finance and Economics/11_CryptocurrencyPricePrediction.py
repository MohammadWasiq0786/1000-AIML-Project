Project 491: Cryptocurrency Price Prediction
Description:
Cryptocurrency price prediction aims to forecast future prices of cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, or Litecoin, based on historical market data. In this project, we will use a LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) model to predict the price of Bitcoin based on historical data, similar to stock price prediction, but for volatile cryptocurrencies.

For real-world use:

You can use APIs like Binance, CoinGecko, or CryptoCompare for real-time cryptocurrency data.

To improve accuracy, use additional features such as social media sentiment, technical indicators, or market news.

âœ… What It Does:
Downloads historical Bitcoin prices using yfinance.

Preprocesses the data using MinMaxScaler to normalize it for LSTM.

Trains an LSTM model to predict Bitcoin's price based on the past 60 days.

Plots actual vs. predicted prices to evaluate the model.

Key Extensions and Customizations:
Use multiple cryptocurrencies: Extend the model to predict Ethereum, Litecoin, or any other cryptocurrency by adding them as additional features.

Use technical indicators: Add moving averages, RSI, or MACD as additional features for more accurate predictions.

Social media sentiment: Integrate data from Twitter or Reddit to predict market sentiment and improve forecasting.

Deploy for real-time predictions: Use WebSocket connections to stream live data and make real-time predictions.
