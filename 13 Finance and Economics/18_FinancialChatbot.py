"""
Project 498: Financial Chatbot Implementation
Description:
A financial chatbot helps users with various financial tasks such as checking account balances, investing advice, loan status, or financial product recommendations. In this project, we will implement a simple rule-based chatbot using Natural Language Processing (NLP) to assist with basic financial queries.

For real-world applications:

Integrate with banking APIs, investment platforms, or personal finance management systems.

Use more advanced techniques like dialog management and reinforcement learning for a better user experience.

âœ… What It Does:
Simulates a rule-based financial chatbot that responds to user queries like account balance, loan status, and investment advice.

Processes user input using regular expressions to match specific queries and provide appropriate responses.

Offers simple financial advice and answers basic questions.

Key Extensions and Customizations:
Integrate with banking APIs to provide real-time account balance and loan status updates.

Use NLP models like GPT-3, Dialogflow, or Rasa for more complex conversational capabilities and natural language understanding.

Expand chatbot capabilities: Add support for transactions, reminders, financial planning, and personalized investment advice.
