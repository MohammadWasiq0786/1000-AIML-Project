Project 501: High-Frequency Trading Simulation
Description:
High-frequency trading (HFT) involves executing a large number of trades at extremely fast speeds, typically leveraging algorithmic strategies to exploit small price movements. In this project, we will simulate an HFT strategy using moving averages and order book data to perform real-time trading simulations based on predefined rules.

For real-world systems:

Integrate with live market data (e.g., from Alpaca, Interactive Brokers, or Binance API).

Implement more advanced strategies like statistical arbitrage or market-making.

âœ… What It Does:
Simulates high-frequency price data (price data changing every 5 minutes).

Implements a simple moving average crossover strategy:

Buy when the short-term moving average crosses above the long-term moving average.

Sell when the short-term moving average crosses below the long-term moving average.

Tracks the balance and number of shares held as the strategy executes buy/sell signals.

Visualizes the trading strategy performance by plotting the stock price along with the moving averages and buy/sell signals.

Key Extensions and Customizations:
Real-time data: Replace simulated data with live market data from Alpaca, Binance, or Interactive Brokers using their APIs.

Advanced strategies: Implement more advanced strategies like statistical arbitrage, momentum trading, or market-making.

Backtesting: Extend the project with a backtesting framework to evaluate performance over multiple years of data.
