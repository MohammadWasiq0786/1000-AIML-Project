Project 507: Financial Stress Test Simulation
Description:
A financial stress test simulates extreme economic conditions (e.g., a financial crisis or market crash) to evaluate the resilience of financial institutions, portfolios, or individual assets. In this project, we will simulate a stress test by applying shocks to key financial variables, such as stock prices, interest rates, and market volatility, to assess the impact on a hypothetical portfolio.

For real-world applications:

Use historical financial crises data (e.g., 2008 Financial Crisis) to simulate stress scenarios.

You can also integrate Monte Carlo simulations or Scenario Analysis to evaluate different stress scenarios.

About:

âœ… What It Does:
Simulates a portfolio with two assets: stock and bond, with assumed returns and volatilities.

Simulates a stress test by applying shocks (e.g., a 30% stock price drop and 10% bond price drop due to an interest rate hike).

Visualizes the portfolio value before and after the stress test, showing the impact of the shocks.

Calculates the drop in portfolio value due to the stress scenario.

Key Extensions and Customizations:
Use real historical data: Replace simulated data with actual asset returns from Yahoo Finance or other financial data sources.

Multiple stress scenarios: Implement different stress scenarios such as economic downturns, geopolitical events, or liquidity crises.

Monte Carlo simulation: Use Monte Carlo methods to simulate a range of potential stress test scenarios based on historical volatility.

Portfolio optimization: Extend the model to optimize the portfolio's risk-return trade-off and stress-test different portfolio compositions.
