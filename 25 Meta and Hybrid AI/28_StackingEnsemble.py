Project 988: Stacking Ensemble Implementation
Description
Stacking is an ensemble learning technique where multiple base models (diverse algorithms) are trained, and their predictions are combined using a meta-model (often a simple model like logistic regression or another machine learning algorithm). The goal is to leverage the strengths of different models to improve predictive performance.

In this project, we will implement a stacking ensemble using base models like Random Forest and Gradient Boosting, and combine them using a Logistic Regression meta-model.

Key Concepts Covered:
Stacking: Stacking combines the predictions of multiple base models by training a meta-model (often called a blender or final estimator) to learn the best way to combine those predictions. Itâ€™s one of the most powerful ensemble learning methods.

Base Models: These are the individual models (e.g., Random Forest and Gradient Boosting) that make predictions.

Meta-model: This is the model that combines the predictions from the base models. In our case, we used Logistic Regression.

Diversity of Models: By combining different algorithms, stacking can leverage the strengths of each model, often leading to improved predictive accuracy.
