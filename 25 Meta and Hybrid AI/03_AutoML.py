Project 963: AutoML Implementation
Description
AutoML (Automated Machine Learning) automates the process of selecting models, hyperparameters, and feature engineering, making machine learning more accessible and efficient. In this project, we'll implement a simple AutoML pipeline that can automatically choose models and hyperparameters for a classification task.

Key Concepts Covered:
AutoML with TPOT: Automatically tunes models and selects the best-performing pipeline using evolutionary algorithms.

Genetic Algorithm: A search method that uses the concept of survival of the fittest to evolve models.

Model Export: TPOT allows you to export the best pipeline to a Python script, which can be reused for predictions.
