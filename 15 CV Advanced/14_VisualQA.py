Project 574: Visual Question Answering
Description:
Visual question answering (VQA) involves answering natural language questions about an image. The model needs to process both the visual content (image) and the textual content (question) to generate an appropriate answer. In this project, we will use a pre-trained model to answer questions about an image.
