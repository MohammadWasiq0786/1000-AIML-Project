Project 573: Vision-and-Language Navigation
Description:
Vision-and-language navigation involves navigating an environment based on instructions given in natural language while using visual input (e.g., a map or a scene from a camera). This task requires both vision understanding and language comprehension. In this project, we will simulate vision-and-language navigation using a pre-trained model like VisualBERT or CLIP to understand and follow navigation instructions.

# 1. Load pre-trained CLIP model and processor
model = CLIPModel.from_pretrained("openai/clip-vit-base-patch32")
processor = CLIPProcessor.from_pretrained("openai/clip-vit-base-patch32")
 
# 2. Load an image of the environment (e.g., scene captured by a camera in the navigation task)
image = Image.open("path_to_image.jpg")  # Replace with an actual image path
 
# 3. Define a navigation instruction (e.g., "Turn left and move towards the red car")
navigation_instruction = "Turn left and move towards the red car"
 
# 4. Preprocess the image and instruction
inputs = processor(text=[navigation_instruction], images=image, return_tensors="pt", padding=True)
 
# 5. Perform vision-and-language navigation (image-text similarity)
outputs = model(**inputs)
logits_per_image = outputs.logits_per_image  # Image-text similarity
probs = logits_per_image.softmax(dim=1)  # Get the probabilities
 
# 6. Display the result
