Project 578: Video Dialogue Systems
Description:
Video dialogue systems allow users to interact with a system by asking questions or giving commands related to video content. These systems need to understand the visual and temporal dynamics of the video, as well as natural language. In this project, we will implement a video dialogue system that enables users to interact with video content using both text and visual cues.
