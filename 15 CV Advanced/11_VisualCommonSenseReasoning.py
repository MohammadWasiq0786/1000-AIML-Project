Project 571: Visual Common Sense Reasoning
Description:
Visual common sense reasoning involves making inferences about the world based on visual inputs. For example, reasoning about how objects interact in a scene or understanding implicit relationships like "a person is likely to sit on a chair." This project aims to use a pre-trained model to perform reasoning tasks on images that require common sense understanding.

# 1. Load pre-trained CLIP model and processor
model = CLIPModel.from_pretrained("openai/clip-vit-base-patch32")

# 2. Load an image for visual reasoning
image = Image.open("path_to_image.jpg")  # Replace with an actual image path
 
# 3. Define possible reasoning prompts based on common sense (e.g., "a person is sitting on a chair")
prompts = [
    "a person is sitting on a chair",
    "a dog is running in the park",

inputs = processor(text=prompts, images=image, return_tensors="pt", padding=True)
 
# 5. Perform common sense reasoning to evaluate which prompt matches the image best

logits_per_image = outputs.logits_per_image  # Image-text similarity
