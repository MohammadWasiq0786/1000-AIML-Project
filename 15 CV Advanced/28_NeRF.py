Project 588: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF)
Description:
Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) is a deep learning model for generating 3D scenes from 2D images. It can render photorealistic 3D scenes by modeling how light interacts with the scene. NeRF is particularly useful in applications like virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), and 3D reconstruction. In this project, we will implement a NeRF model for generating 3D views from a set of 2D images.

Note: Implementing NeRF requires significant computational resources and may take some time to set up, as it involves complex 3D rendering. Here's an outline of how you can get started with a simplified NeRF implementation using a pre-trained model.

from nerf_model import NeRFModel  # Assuming a simplified NeRF model is implemented
 
# 1. Load a pre-trained NeRF model (for 3D scene generation)
model = NeRFModel()
 
# 2. Prepare a dataset of 2D images and camera positions (this dataset is typically custom)
# Here, we will simulate a dataset for the sake of demonstration.
# In real implementation, you would use a dataset like BlendedMVS or custom 3D datasets.
camera_positions = np.random.rand(100, 3)  # Random camera positions in 3D space
images = np.random.rand(100, 256, 256, 3)  # Random 2D images (replace with real images)
 
# 3. Define a DataLoader for the dataset
class NeRFDataset(torch.utils.data.Dataset):
    def __init__(self, images, camera_positions):
        self.images = images
        self.camera_positions = camera_positions
 
    def __len__(self):
        return len(self.images)
 
    def __getitem__(self, idx):
        return torch.tensor(self.images[idx], dtype=torch.float32), torch.tensor(self.camera_positions[idx], dtype=torch.float32)
 
dataset = NeRFDataset(images, camera_positions)
data_loader = DataLoader(dataset, batch_size=4, shuffle=True)
 
# 4. Define the loss function and optimizer
criterion = nn.MSELoss()
optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.001)
 
# 5. Training loop for NeRF
def train_nerf(model, data_loader, criterion, optimizer, num_epochs=5):
    for epoch in range(num_epochs):
        model.train()
        total_loss = 0
        for images, positions in data_loader:
            optimizer.zero_grad()
 
            # Forward pass through the NeRF model
            predicted_images = model(positions)  # The model should predict 3D views
 
            # Compute the loss
            loss = criterion(predicted_images, images)
            loss.backward()
            optimizer.step()
 
            total_loss += loss.item()
 
        print(f"Epoch {epoch+1}, Loss: {total_loss / len(data_loader)}")
 
# 6. Train the NeRF model
train_nerf(model, data_loader, criterion, optimizer)
 
# 7. Visualize a generated 3D scene (for simplicity, here we're visualizing 2D images)
# In a full NeRF model, this would involve 3D rendering, but we are simplifying for demonstration.
