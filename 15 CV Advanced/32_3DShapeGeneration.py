Project 592: 3D Shape Generation
Description:
3D shape generation involves creating 3D shapes from scratch or from partial data, which is important in fields like 3D modeling, virtual reality, and CAD systems. This task typically leverages generative models such as GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks) to generate novel shapes. In this project, we will implement 3D shape generation using a 3D GAN model.

# Note: In a real scenario, you'd visualize the generated 3D shape with a 3D rendering library like Open3D or PyTorch3D.
