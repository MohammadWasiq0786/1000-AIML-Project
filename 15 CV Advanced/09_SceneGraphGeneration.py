Project 569: Scene Graph Generation
Description:
Scene graph generation involves extracting objects, attributes, and relationships from images and representing them in a graph format. This is useful for tasks like visual question answering and image captioning. In this project, we will generate scene graphs from images using deep learning models to extract objects and their relationships.
