Project 568: Visual Reasoning Systems
Description:
Visual reasoning systems combine both visual input (images or videos) and textual input to perform reasoning tasks. These systems aim to answer complex questions about the visual content, such as "What is the person doing in the image?" or "How many cars are visible in the scene?" In this project, we will explore visual reasoning tasks using pre-trained models like VisualBERT or UNITER, which integrate both visual and textual data.
