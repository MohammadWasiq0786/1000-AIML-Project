Project 570: Visual Relationship Detection
Description:
Visual relationship detection involves identifying relationships between objects in an image, such as "person riding a bike" or "dog sitting on a chair." This task is crucial for understanding complex scenes and is widely used in applications like scene understanding and image captioning. In this project, we will use a pre-trained model to detect relationships between objects in images.
