Project 591: 3D Shape Completion
Description:
3D shape completion refers to the process of completing missing or occluded parts of a 3D shape based on the visible portions. This is especially useful in applications like robotics, virtual reality, and 3D reconstruction. In this project, we will implement 3D shape completion using a model that can predict the missing parts of a shape from a partial input.
