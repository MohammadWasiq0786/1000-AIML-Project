Project 535: Text Complexity Adjustment
Description:
Text complexity adjustment involves modifying the complexity of text to suit a target audience. This project will focus on adjusting the complexity of a text by either simplifying or making it more advanced, depending on the desired output. We'll use a transformer model to adjust the complexity level of a given input text.

from transformers import pipeline
 
# 1. Load pre-trained text generation model for text adjustment
text_adjuster = pipeline("text2text-generation", model="t5-small")
 
# 2. Provide a complex text to simplify or adjust the complexity
complex_text = "The implementation of novel algorithms into systems engineering aims to optimize multi-dimensional data streams for better efficiency."
 
# 3. Use the model to adjust the text complexity (simplifying for easier understanding)
simplified_text = text_adjuster(f"simplify: {complex_text}", max_length=100, num_return_sequences=1)
 
# 4. Use the model to increase complexity (making the text more advanced)
advanced_text = text_adjuster(f"advance: {complex_text}", max_length=150, num_return_sequences=1)
 
# 5. Display the results
print(f"Simplified Text: {simplified_text[0]['generated_text']}")
print(f"Advanced Text: {advanced_text[0]['generated_text']}")
