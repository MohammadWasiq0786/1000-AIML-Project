Project 554: Stance Detection in Text
Description:
Stance detection involves determining the stance or position a writer takes in a piece of text toward a target, such as whether the text is supporting, against, or neutral toward the target. In this project, we will build a stance detection model using a transformer-based model for classifying the stance of text toward a target.

from transformers import pipeline
 
# 1. Load pre-trained model for stance detection (can be fine-tuned for specific task)
classifier = pipeline("text-classification", model="bert-base-uncased")
 
# 2. Provide a target and text expressing a stance toward that target
target = "climate change"
text = "I believe that the evidence strongly supports the need for immediate action on climate change."
 
# 3. Classify the stance (support, against, or neutral)
stance = classifier(f"The stance toward {target} is: {text}")
 
# 4. Display the result
print(f"Detected Stance: {stance[0]['label']} with confidence {stance[0]['score']:.2f}")
