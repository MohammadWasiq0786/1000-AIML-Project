Project 548: Response Generation for Chatbots
Description:
Response generation is a crucial component of chatbots, where the goal is to generate relevant and coherent responses based on user inputs. In this project, we will use a pre-trained transformer model (e.g., DialoGPT or GPT-2) to generate human-like responses to user queries.

from transformers import pipeline
 
# 1. Load pre-trained DialoGPT model for response generation
chatbot = pipeline("conversational", model="microsoft/DialoGPT-medium")
 
# 2. Define a function to generate a response based on user input
def generate_response(user_input):
    response = chatbot(user_input)
    return response[0]['generated_text']
 
# 3. Simulate a conversation with the chatbot
user_input = "Hi there! How are you doing today?"
bot_response = generate_response(user_input)
print(f"Bot: {bot_response}")
 
# Continue the conversation with another user input
user_input = "Tell me something interesting."
bot_response = generate_response(user_input)
print(f"Bot: {bot_response}")
