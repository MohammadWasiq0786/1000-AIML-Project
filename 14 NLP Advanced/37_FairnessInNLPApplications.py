"""
Project 557: Fairness in NLP Applications
Description:
Fairness in NLP applications focuses on ensuring that models do not exhibit biased behavior or make discriminatory decisions based on sensitive attributes like gender, race, or age. In this project, we will analyze the fairness of an NLP model using various fairness metrics and identify potential biases in its predictions.

# 1. Load pre-trained model for text classification

# 2. Define text examples with potential fairness concerns
